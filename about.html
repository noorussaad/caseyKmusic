            Casey K. has a sound that doesn’t come around often. Her voice has a strength that is honest, intimate and sourced from the soul. She might remind you of Norah Jones or Adele or Amy Winehouse even, but really, Casey’s musical world is all her own.

            All of her work and passion will be on display with the release of In Tine, Casey K’s debut EP out March 21, 2013.  In Tine (a reference to the twin prongs of a tuning fork) showcases seven self-penned songs that sum up her poetic, yet playful, personality. These qualities attracted world-renowned producer and engineer, Casaba Petocz, her partner-in-crime for the project.  Petocz has worked with Michael Jackson, Elton John, Stevie Nicks and Etta James, to name a few. The two had previously collaborated on a project when Casey was in college. So when Casey asked him to work with her on her own material, he did so without hesitation.  Their chemistry and collective musicality is a force to be reckoned with.  In Tine is the culmination of their creative journey.

            Casey K. has been playing, performing, and writing music her entire life. Growing up in West Hollywood, she was immersed in the entertainment industry at a young age. From listening to jazz greats, going to see Broadway shows, and belting out Motown hits with her mom, she always knew she wanted a life on the stage. After graduating from high school she zipped across town and earned a degree in Theatre from USC. She also spent time studying music production and learning to play guitar and piano. Through it all, Casey K. has stayed true to what she knows and needs – songwriting.

            Casey’s a dedicated soul surfer and draws inspiration from her second home, the beaches of Maui. When she is not making music, you can find her with her feet in the sand or her “toes on the nose” of her longboard. Whether it’s on a wave or in her music Casey K. loves, “the risk and the calm.” Her melodies keep you guessing. She pushes herself and audiences into territory unknown. Like the tide, her songs pull you in.

            Casey has performed at the House of Blues (Hollywood), SXSW (Austin), A’ali’ikuhonua Creative Arts Center (Hawaii), The Triad Club (New York City), and the Bluebird Café (Nashville). She also shot the music video for “Maureen,” one of In Tine’s soulful seductions, on location in Paris. Her music has been played on ESPN, MTV, and sampled by some of the top international DJs.

            Her songs speak the truth. Her poise and presence is palpable. Casey K. is the real deal.
